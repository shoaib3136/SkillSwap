# SkillSwap

## 🧩 Problem Statement
In today’s world, millions of people have valuable skills, yet many can’t afford traditional learning platforms or don’t know where to find trusted peer-to-peer learning opportunities.
Skill Swap Platform solves this problem by creating a space where users can trade their skills directly with others. Think of it as a modern-day barter system, where the currency is knowledge.

### Real-world Examples:
  + A web developer teaches a yoga instructor how to build a website in exchange for private yoga sessions.
  + A photographer helps a writer with photo editing, and the writer helps improve their storytelling portfolio.
  + A student offers math tutoring in return for coding lessons.

## 💡 What is Skill Swap Platform?

  + Create a profile listing their skills offered and skills wanted.
  + Search and browse public profiles by availability or skill category.
  + Send skill swap requests with custom messages.

## 🤖 Tech Stack
The SkillSwap platform is built using a modern tech stack with React and TypeScript on the frontend, powered by Vite for fast development. The UI leverages Tailwind CSS for styling combined with Headless UI components, while state management is handled efficiently with Zustand. For forms and validation, we use React Hook Form with Zod schemas. The backend runs on Node.js with Express, featuring MongoDB for data storage via Mongoose, and uses JWT for secure authentication. API communication is managed through Axios with proper interceptors for error handling. The project includes comprehensive testing with Vitest and React Testing Library, along with developer tools like ESLint, Prettier, and Husky for code quality.
